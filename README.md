# NOTICE: Spicy is discontinued, hypixel devs looked at the repo and patched everything. New client is hummus and the repo for that is [here](hhttps://github.com/Hummus-Appreciation-Club/Hummus-Client-New). If you cannot see the repo then you have not been invited to it.

# SpicyClient - The open source hypixel client (discontinued)
Spicy is an open source Minecraft client that I create in my free time, you are free to reference and copy my code. There are two reasons why made it open source, The first one is that protecting the jar is annoying and the second is that I want people to be able to reference code whenever they need to. If you find any bugs or a hack is not currently bypassing then feel free to contact me. If you have any code that you want added to the client then you may also contact me

Note: If you cannot connect to our servers then you can ~~go fuck yourself~~ check our [status page](https://status.spicyclient.info/) to see if anyone else if having issues. If our servers are down feel free to contact/ping lavaflowglow on discord to notify him

Pull requests with little code changed will not be merged

## Most problems can be solved on the [wiki](https://github.com/NathanKassab/SpicyClient/wiki)

## How to modify the code
Coming soon

## Exporting the client into a jar
